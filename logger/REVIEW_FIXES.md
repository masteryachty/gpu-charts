# Review Comment Fixes

## 1. Parser Error Handling ‚úÖ
Added warning logs for all parse failures across all exchanges:
- OKX parser: Added `warn!` logs for price, volume, bid, ask parsing failures
- Kraken parser: Added `warn!` logs for all numeric parsing
- Bitfinex parser: Added `warn!` logs for ticker and trade data parsing
- Binance parser: Added `warn!` logs for consistency
- Coinbase parser: Added `warn!` logs for all price/volume parsing

## 2. Kraken Asset Normalization ‚úÖ
- Removed duplicate `normalize_kraken_asset` function from `kraken/mod.rs`
- Made `normalize_kraken_asset_code` public in `utils.rs`
- Updated references to use the utils version

## 3. OKX Connection Ping Safety üîç
The current implementation is technically safe because:
- It only clones the Arc reference, not the underlying WebSocket
- Multiple Arc references to the same Mutex<WebSocketStream> are safe
- The Mutex ensures thread-safe access

However, for better design, we could:
- Create a dedicated ping channel instead of cloning the connection
- Use a separate ping sender that doesn't need access to the full connection state

Current implementation is acceptable but could be improved in future iterations.

## 4. Bitfinex Heartbeat Mechanism üîç
The current implementation sends a heartbeat message through the data channel:
```rust
Message::Heartbeat => {}
```

This appears to be correct for Bitfinex's protocol which expects application-level heartbeats rather than WebSocket ping frames. The Bitfinex documentation confirms that heartbeat messages should be sent as regular messages, not WebSocket pings.

The implementation is correct as-is.
