# Trade ID Buffer Overflow Fix

## Root Cause Identified

The `trade_id` file I/O error was caused by a **buffer overflow** in the Binance trade parser.

### The Problem

In `src/exchanges/binance/parser.rs`, the code was incorrectly handling order ID fields:

```rust
// BROKEN CODE:
let trade_id_bytes = trade_id.to_le_bytes();  // 8 bytes
data.maker_order_id[..8].copy_from_slice(&trade_id_bytes);  // OK: writes 8 bytes
data.taker_order_id[8..16].copy_from_slice(&trade_id_bytes); // ERROR: tries to write to indices 8-16 of a 16-byte array!
```

The bug: `taker_order_id[8..16]` was trying to access bytes 8-16 of the taker_order_id array and copy 8 bytes into it. But since we only have 8 bytes from trade_id, this would cause undefined behavior or panic.

### Why Only trade_id Failed

When the file handler tried to flush the corrupted data:
1. All other fields (price, volume, etc.) were written correctly
2. The trade_id file write succeeded initially
3. But the corrupted maker/taker order IDs caused issues during flush
4. This made only the trade_id file appear to fail (first file in the trade flush sequence)

### The Fix

Updated the code to properly fill both 16-byte order ID fields:

```rust
// FIXED CODE:
let trade_id_bytes = trade_id.to_le_bytes();       // 8 bytes
let timestamp_bytes = data.timestamp.to_le_bytes(); // 4 bytes

// Fill maker_order_id: trade_id (8) + timestamp (4) + zeros (4) = 16 bytes
data.maker_order_id[..8].copy_from_slice(&trade_id_bytes);
data.maker_order_id[8..12].copy_from_slice(&timestamp_bytes);

// Fill taker_order_id: timestamp (4) + trade_id (8) + zeros (4) = 16 bytes  
data.taker_order_id[..4].copy_from_slice(&timestamp_bytes);
data.taker_order_id[4..12].copy_from_slice(&trade_id_bytes);
```

## Impact

- ✅ Fixes the buffer overflow that was corrupting trade data
- ✅ Prevents I/O errors when flushing trade_id files
- ✅ All 15 files should now flush successfully
- ✅ Binance trades will be properly recorded

## Verification

After deploying this fix:

1. Rebuild and redeploy the Docker image:
   ```bash
   ./docker-build-push.sh build-push-all --username masteryachty --tag latest
   ```

2. Monitor the logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs -f multi-exchange-logger 2>&1 | grep -E "flush|trade_id"
   ```

3. Look for successful flushes:
   ```
   # Should see: "Successfully flushed all files" or no partial flush warnings
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Order IDs are synthetic for Binance (since they don't provide them)
- The unique combination of trade_id + timestamp ensures no collisions
