# Binance I/O Error Comprehensive Fix

## Problem Analysis
The persistent I/O error (os error 5) indicates that Binance's data files cannot be flushed to disk. This is happening every 5 seconds (the flush interval).

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Fixed Retry Logic
- Updated error detection to properly identify I/O errors by checking error string
- Now correctly retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Previous version was failing after 1 attempt due to incorrect error type checking

### 2. Partial Flush Support
- Modified flush_all_files to continue even if some files fail
- Logs which specific files failed (e.g., "md_price", "trade_id")
- Only fails completely if ALL files fail to flush
- This allows some data to be saved even if certain files have issues

### 3. Enhanced Error Context
- Better logging shows exactly which files are problematic
- Tracks successful vs failed flush operations
- Helps identify if it's a specific file or system-wide issue

## Root Cause Possibilities

### 1. File System Full
```bash
df -h /mnt/md/data/
```

### 2. Permission Issues
```bash
ls -la /mnt/md/data/binance/
namei -l /mnt/md/data/binance/
```

### 3. Stale File Handles
```bash
lsof | grep binance | grep deleted
```

### 4. Network Mount Issues
```bash
mount | grep /mnt/md
systemctl status nfs-client.target  # if using NFS
```

## Emergency Workarounds

### 1. Restart the Logger
This will create fresh file handles:
```bash
docker restart <container_name>
```

### 2. Clear Old Data
If disk is full:
```bash
find /mnt/md/data/binance -name "*.bin" -mtime +7 -delete
```

### 3. Remount the File System
```bash
umount /mnt/md/data && mount /mnt/md/data
```

### 4. Use Local Storage Temporarily
Update config to use local path:
```yaml
logger:
  data_path: /tmp/logger-data  # Temporary local storage
```

## Long-term Solutions

### 1. Implement Write-Through Cache
Buffer to local disk first, then sync to network storage:
```rust
// Write to local cache
local_buffer.write(data)?;

// Async sync to network storage
tokio::spawn(async move {
    if let Err(e) = sync_to_network(data).await {
        error!("Network sync failed: {}", e);
        // Data is safe in local cache
    }
});
```

### 2. Add Health Checks
Before creating files, test write access:
```rust
// Test write before creating files
let test_file = format!("{}/test_{}.tmp", path, pid);
std::fs::write(&test_file, b"test")?;
std::fs::remove_file(test_file)?;
```

### 3. Implement File Rotation
Close and reopen files periodically to avoid stale handles:
```rust
// Rotate files every hour
if last_rotation.elapsed() > Duration::from_hours(1) {
    self.close_all_files()?;
    self.reopen_all_files()?;
}
```

## Monitoring Commands

Check for I/O errors in real-time:
```bash
# Watch for errors
tail -f /var/log/logger.log | grep -E "Failed to flush|I/O error"

# Check system logs
dmesg -T | grep -i error
journalctl -xe | grep -i "i/o error"

# Monitor disk I/O
iostat -x 1
iotop -o
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Monitor logs for retry attempts:
   ```
   grep "I/O error during flush" /var/log/logger.log
   ```
3. Check if partial flushes are working:
   ```
   grep "Partial flush success" /var/log/logger.log
   ```

## Summary

The updated code now:
1. ✅ Properly detects and retries I/O errors
2. ✅ Continues operation even if some files fail
3. ✅ Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting
4. ✅ Keeps data in memory buffer when disk writes fail

This ensures maximum data preservation while the underlying storage issue is resolved.
