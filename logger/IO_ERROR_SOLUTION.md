# Binance I/O Error Solution

## Problem
Persistent "Input/output error (os error 5)" when flushing data to disk for Binance exchange.

## Root Causes
1. **Network File System Issues**: The production system uses `/mnt/md/data/` which appears to be a network-mounted volume
2. **Transient Connectivity**: Network storage can have intermittent connectivity issues
3. **Permission/Access Issues**: The mounted volume may have changing permissions or access restrictions

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
Added retry mechanism in `file_handlers.rs`:
- Retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms, 400ms)
- Only retries on I/O errors (ErrorKind::Other)
- Logs warnings during retries for monitoring

### 2. Enhanced Error Logging
Updated `binance/mod.rs` to provide better context:
- Continues running even if flush fails (data remains in memory buffer)
- Logs specific message for I/O errors to help identify disk issues

### 3. Configuration Adjustments
No changes needed - the 5-second flush interval is reasonable

## Additional Recommendations

### System-Level Solutions
1. **Check Mount Status**:
   ```bash
   mount | grep /mnt/md
   df -h /mnt/md/data/
   ```

2. **Monitor Disk Health**:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i error
   journalctl -u logger --since "1 hour ago" | grep -i "i/o error"
   ```

3. **Verify Permissions**:
   ```bash
   ls -la /mnt/md/data/
   touch /mnt/md/data/test.txt && rm /mnt/md/data/test.txt
   ```

### Alternative Storage Options
1. **Local Buffer First**: Write to local disk, then sync to network storage
2. **Use Local SSD**: Store data locally if network storage is unreliable
3. **Implement Write-Through Cache**: Buffer locally and write to network asynchronously

### Monitoring
Add metrics for:
- Flush success/failure rates
- Retry counts
- Buffer sizes when flushes fail

## Code Changes Summary
1. ✅ Added retry logic with exponential backoff in `file_handlers.rs`
2. ✅ Enhanced error logging in `binance/mod.rs`
3. ✅ Application continues running even if flushes fail

## Testing
Run the test script to verify behavior:
```bash
./test-flush-behavior.sh
```

## Production Deployment
1. Deploy the updated code with retry logic
2. Monitor logs for retry attempts
3. If errors persist, investigate system-level issues
4. Consider implementing local buffering as a fallback
