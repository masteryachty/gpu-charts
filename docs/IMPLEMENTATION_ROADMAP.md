## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path to achieving the ambitious performance goals of the GPU Charts system. By following this phased approach, we can incrementally deliver value while maintaining system stability and performance.

The total timeline of 12-16 weeks assumes dedicated resources and parallel development where possible. Each phase builds on the previous work, with clear deliverables and success metrics.

Priority should be given to Phases 4-6 as they provide the largest performance improvements. Phases 9-11 can be adjusted based on business priorities and user feedback.
