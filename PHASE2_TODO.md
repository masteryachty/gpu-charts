# Phase 2 Implementation Tasks

## High Priority - Core Functionality
- [ ] Fix compilation errors in all crates
- [ ] Implement proper ChartSystem in wasm-bridge as per architect.md
- [ ] Connect data-manager with actual GPU buffer creation
- [ ] Implement chart renderers (line, candlestick, bar, area) in renderer crate

## Performance Optimizations (Phase 3 from architect.md)
- [ ] Implement Binary Culling Algorithm (25,000x improvement)
  - GPU compute shader for binary search culling
  - Only process visible data points
  - Logarithmic complexity vs linear scanning
- [ ] Implement Vertex Compression (<8 bytes per vertex)
  - Time: 32-bit offset from base timestamp
  - Value: 16-bit normalized with scale/offset
  - Flags: 16-bit for color/style info
- [ ] Implement GPU Vertex Generation
  - Vertices generated entirely in vertex shader
  - No CPU-GPU vertex buffer transfers
  - Dynamic LOD based on zoom level

## Data Manager Enhancements
- [ ] Implement SIMD optimizations for data processing
- [ ] Add proper LRU cache with configurable size
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for HTTP/2
- [ ] Add Brotli/gzip compression support
- [ ] Implement chunked data loading for large datasets

## Config System Features
- [ ] Implement auto-tuning based on GPU capabilities
- [ ] Add performance metrics tracking
- [ ] Implement quality preset switching
- [ ] Add rendering preset configurations for common chart types
- [ ] Implement hot-reload support for configuration

## Renderer Features
- [ ] Implement multi-pass rendering system
- [ ] Add MSAA support (2x, 4x, 8x based on quality preset)
- [ ] Implement viewport culling
- [ ] Add dirty state tracking for axis renderers
- [ ] Implement proper chart type switching

## Additional Features from architect.md
- [ ] WebSocket integration for streaming updates
- [ ] Multi-chart synchronization (synchronized cursors)
- [ ] Custom indicators (user-defined calculations)
- [ ] Mobile optimization (touch events, lower memory)
- [ ] WebGPU compute shaders for more GPU-side processing

## Infrastructure
- [ ] Add proper error handling throughout
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Add documentation for new architecture

## React Integration
- [ ] Update React hooks to use new ChartSystem API
- [ ] Implement proper state synchronization
- [ ] Add TypeScript definitions for new WASM exports
- [ ] Update component lifecycle management
