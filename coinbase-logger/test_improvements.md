# Coinbase Logger Improvements Test Plan

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Connection Pooling (✓)
- **Before**: 200+ individual WebSocket connections (one per symbol)
- **After**: 10 connections handling ~20 symbols each
- **Benefit**: 20x reduction in connections, respects rate limits

### 2. Message Buffering & Sorting (✓)
- **Before**: Messages written immediately as they arrive (out of order)
- **After**: 1-second buffer with BTreeMap for automatic timestamp sorting
- **Benefit**: Guaranteed chronological order within each connection

### 3. Nanosecond Precision (✓)
- **Before**: Only seconds stored, nanoseconds lost
- **After**: Separate `nanos.{date}.bin` file preserves full precision
- **Benefit**: No timestamp precision loss

### 4. Exponential Backoff (✓)
- **Before**: Fixed 5-second reconnection delay
- **After**: Starts at 1s, doubles up to 60s max
- **Benefit**: Less aggressive on failures, faster recovery on transient issues

### 5. Rate-Limited Connection Creation (✓)
- **Before**: All connections created at once
- **After**: 1 connection per second respecting API limits
- **Benefit**: Avoids rate limiting during startup

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Build and run: `cargo run --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
2. Verify connection pooling: Should see "Connection 0-9: Handling X symbols"
3. Check message buffering: Look for "Flushing X messages" logs
4. Verify file creation: Check for new `nanos.{date}.bin` files
5. Test reconnection: Kill network briefly, observe exponential backoff

### Expected Output Structure:
```
/usr/src/app/data/{symbol}/MD/
├── time.{date}.bin     # Seconds (u32)
├── nanos.{date}.bin    # Nanoseconds (u32) - NEW!
├── price.{date}.bin    # Price (f32)
├── volume.{date}.bin   # Volume (f32)
├── side.{date}.bin     # Side (u8 padded to 4 bytes)
├── best_bid.{date}.bin # Best bid (f32)
└── best_ask.{date}.bin # Best ask (f32)
```

### Performance Expectations:
- **Memory Usage**: Slightly higher due to 1-second buffers
- **Network Usage**: Significantly reduced (10 vs 200+ connections)
- **CPU Usage**: More efficient with batched writes
- **Disk I/O**: Better with sorted batch writes vs random individual writes
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Perfect with nanosecond precision preserved

## Next Steps for Production:
1. Add metrics/monitoring for buffer sizes and flush rates
2. Consider configurable buffer size/flush interval
3. Add health check endpoint
4. Implement graceful shutdown with buffer flush
5. Add compression for historical data
