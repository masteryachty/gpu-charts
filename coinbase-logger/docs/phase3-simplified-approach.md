# Phase 3 Simplified: Trade Analytics Without File Complexity

## UPDATE: Automatic File Rotation Now Implemented

As of the latest update, the coinbase-logger includes **automatic internal file rotation at midnight**. This eliminates the need for external restart mechanisms:

- **Automatic Detection**: Every 5 seconds, checks if date has changed
- **Seamless Rotation**: Flushes data, closes old files, creates new files with new date
- **Zero Downtime**: WebSocket connections maintained throughout rotation
- **No Dependencies**: No cron jobs, systemd timers, or Docker restarts needed
- **Reliable**: Works in all deployment scenarios automatically

## Original Phase 3 Documentation

Given the already complex file handling system, we'll implement Phase 3 analytics as in-memory processing that outputs periodic summaries rather than creating dozens of new binary files.

## Simplified Approach

### 1. In-Memory Aggregation
- Process trades in real-time to calculate candles and metrics
- Keep aggregated data in memory
- Log summaries periodically instead of binary files

### 2. Analytics Output
Instead of complex binary files, output:
- JSON summaries every minute
- CSV exports on demand
- Log-based metrics for monitoring

### 3. Benefits
- Easier to implement and test
- No additional file handle overhead
- Human-readable output
- Can be extended later if needed

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add simple aggregation to existing trade processing**
   - Track OHLCV data per symbol
   - Calculate basic metrics
   - Detect significant trades

2. **Periodic reporting**
   - Every 60 seconds, log analytics summary
   - Include: trade count, volume, VWAP, momentum
   - Flag significant trades

3. **Optional persistence**
   - Write daily CSV summaries
   - Export JSON for external processing
   - Keep binary format for raw data only

This approach provides the analytics benefits without the complexity of managing dozens of additional file handles per symbol.
